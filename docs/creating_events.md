# Where to store it
- Your events should ideally be stored in a single shared location so that all your apps can import them as needed.

# Naming conventions for events
- The event name format is `domain_name.event_name`.
- The `domain_name` is the name of the app.
- The event name is lower-cased.
- The only symbols allowed in the `domain_name` and `event_name` are `_`,`a-Z`,`0-9`.
